PCLake is a process-based freshwater ecosystem model. To make PCLake+ readily accessible for collaborative research, PCLake is onboarded into a cloud-based virtual research environment. The platform includes a pre-configured Docker image with the modified PCLake source code, enabling users to launch fully functional instances without local installation. Each virtual-lab instance ships with Jupyter notebooks that provide interactive tutorials, parameter exploration, and result visualization. In addition, reproducible workflow are supplied to run batch scenarios and exploit parallel execution on cloud resources, dramatically reducing simulation time for large ensembles. This virtual research environment lowers technical barriers and promotes reproducibility.
